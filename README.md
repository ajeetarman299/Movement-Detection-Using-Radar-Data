Objective: Built end to end GRU-based DL model for radar-driven human movement detection, enabling robust real-time monitoring.
Collected data using Doppler radar at lab and analyzed signals to classify three movement states: no person, approaching, moving away.
Labeled radar data, visualized with Matplotlib, removed noise, normalized & truncated sequences for a uniform dataset & robust training.
Developed & fine-tuned GRU, LSTM & RNN models, achieving 95% validation & 98% train accuracy with optimized GRU architecture
